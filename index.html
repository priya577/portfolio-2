                    <p>Nature is beauty and beauty is Nature. Everywhere Nature is beautiful in one way or the other. 
                        The beauty of Nature has been a source of inspiration and delight to mankind. It is an endless source of joy.
                        Dew drops on the green grass look like pearls. Sunrise is a lovely scene of Nature. Setting Sun, starry night, silvery light of the Moon, snow-covered mountains, deep and dark forests, scent and fragrance of flowers are some of the beauties of Nature. The chirping of birds in trees has a music of its own. In Spring, Nature is at her best. Blooming flowers of different hues fill the air with fragrance.
                         The beauties of Nature soothe our eyes, gladden our hearts and ennoble our souls.
                         Nature is that natural and physical world that surrounds us and makes life possible on earth. 
                         Nature is the heart of earth. Nature heals us and helps build connection with our freedom, authenticity and our souls. Simply connecting and feeling nature gives us a divine pleasure. We have a strong bond and emotional connection with nature.
                        The serenity of nature calms our hearts.

                    <p>Nature refers to the natural resources and natural surroundings. The life species in nature are interrelated and create balance in nature. They form a natural food chain through which energy is passed to all the species. The series of organisms in which each organism feeds on the one below it in the sequence is called the food chain in natural ecosystem. Food chain includes several plants, organisms, animals and other living species. This natural food chain is the source of energy for the forest species. The energy is passed from one creature to the other which helps them grow and survive.
